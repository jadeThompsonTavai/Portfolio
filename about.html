          Hi There!</div>
    </div>
    <p>It's so nice of you to take the time to visit my page! My name is Jade and I'm currently a Computer and Information Science student in 
    her second year of study.</p>
    <p>My first experience in programming was using scratch. I was given the opportunity to form a group of students and create a game using scratch. 
        In my group, we decided to make a music themed game where you would select the corresponding arrows matching the displayed arrow on the screen
        within a time period. We experimented with different controlling object for the arrows and eventually connected them to foil bowls so the students
        would tap the foil and it would register. Since then my love for creating games has remained and I am currently aiming for a degree in Software development
        and would like to specialise in Game Development. 
    </p>
    <!-- <p>I am also an aspiring artist and often create visual arts. My main subjects are people and character art.</p> -->
    <p>Right now I'm currently working on Web development in my own time. If you want to check out my work history, check out my
